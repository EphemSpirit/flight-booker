This repo is for the <a href=https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms>Flight Booker Project</a>
as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

This project is to utilize Rails' capability for more advanced forms and using nested attributes in model associations. Users will be able to choose what airport they're departing from and which they're arriving at, choose the number of passengers, the date of the flight, as well as put in billing information.
